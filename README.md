# About this Repository

The Quantitative Methods (QM) module (CASA0007) is part of the [CASA’s MSc degree](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/programmes).

This module is designed to demonstrate the integral part that quantitative methods play in research. Students will be introduced to a range of quantitative approaches from the fields of statistics, modelling and data analysis, to serve as tools in their other disciplines. Throughout the course, the focus will be firmly on building conceptual understanding, rather than detailed mathematical manipulation.
